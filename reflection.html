            <h1>Reflection on This Project</h1>
            <p>
                    The purpose of this project was to learn about how briges, specifically in the Philadelphia area can build and disrupt communities. I decided to make a website because I thought that could be an effective way of presenting some research about these questions. 
            </p>

         <h2>The Question</h2>
            <p>
                    The question was how specific bridges in the Philadelphia area connect and disrupt communities. I found out that the development of bridges connect communities, such as the Benjamin Franklin and Walt Whitman bridges. They connect Philly to New Jersey and make travel easier and people could form deeper connections with others with easy methods of commuting to them. They also improve both places economically. One way bridges can disrupt communities is when they get damaged. Damage to bridges can be tragic and sometimes fatal. Also repair is a long process, the I-95 collapse took a long time to repair which led to isolation and it being harder to not only commute to other places to connect with others but also to places such as their jobs for individuals nearby that  were affected. A bridge that has been a big part of my life is the South Street bridge in Philly because it is near my fathers house and used to be a key part of my trip to school each week day. Then it got closed for some minor repairs. It was closed for a long time, and other ways to get to school were discovered. However, the slight annoyance and inconvenience of this bridge being temporarily closed is a lot better than the risk of it hurting people and the repairs helped hopefully prevent that more in the future. A lot of bridges in the Pennsylvania area are in poor conditions which can put citizens at risk. Putting more funding into bridge repairs because of this is crucial. It was important to research bridges and their community impact on people because I don't think many people think about it and its good to get in peoples minds that bridges are not only structures cars cross they're also structures that connect people and communities and have the power to greatly disrupt them.

            <h2>Technical Aspect</h2>
            <p>
                    Doing this project not only taught me about bridges but also more about web development. This website was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. 
                    For the map I used a opensource JavaScript called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a>. 
                    Leaflet makes it simple to make maps and add pop up information to specific points on those maps. You can also set a coordinate for 
                    it to in essence jump to every time the website is refreshed. I did not use any css libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> 
                    because I wanted more control of the customization of it. The navbar and other aspects of the design of this website was inspiration taken from the robotics team 23396 <a href="https://www.hivemindrobotics.net/" target="_blank">Hivemind's website</a> 
                    however an older version not how it is right now. This website is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">github pages</a> because that was a very simple (and free) option. To see my code, you can look at this websites  <a href="https://github.com/philly-bridges/philly-bridges.github.io" target="_blank">repository</a>. 
            </p>

            <h2>Non-technical Aspect</h2>
            <p>
                    I did like making the website more then actually doing the research or doing the general point of this project however that was also fun I suppose.
                    I learned a lot about bridges. And specifically bridges in the Philadelphia area. I learned how they can build communities by connecting people and 
                    hurt communities when they collapse. I also learned that I have a habit of spending a pointless amount of time on things that arent actually specifically 
                    part of the assignment and it would have been a lot easier to just do research and write a paper or something then this. I also started it late I should have 
                    worked on it durring winter break. I'm sorry for it being late but I hope you enjoyed it.
