            <h1>Reflection on This Project</h1>
            <p>
                    The purpose of this project was to learn about how briges, specifically in the Philadelphia area can build and disrupt communities. I decided to make a website because I thought that could be an effective way of presenting some research about these questions. 
            </p>

            <h2>Technical Aspect</h2>
            <p>
                    Doing this project not only taught me about bridges but also more about web development. This website was made using HTML CSS and JavaScript. 
                    For the map I used a opensource JavaScript called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet.js</a>. 
                    Leaflet makes it simple to make maps and add pop up information to specific points on those maps. You can also set a coordinate for 
                    it to in essence jump to every time the website is refreshed. I did not use any css libraries such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> 
                    because I wanted more control of the customization of it. The navbar and other aspects of the design of this website was inspiration taken from the robotics team 23396 <a href="https://www.hivemindrobotics.net/" target="_blank">Hivemind's website</a> 
                    however an older version not how it is right now. This website is hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">github pages</a> because that was a very simple (and free) option. To see my code, you can look at this websites  <a href="https://github.com/philly-bridges/philly-bridges.github.io" target="_blank">repository</a>. 
            </p>

            <h2>Non-technical Aspect</h2>
            <p>
                    I did like making the website more then actually doing the research or doing the general point of this project however that was also fun I suppose.
                    I learned a lot about bridges. And specifically bridges in the Philadelphia area. I learned how they can build communities by connecting people and 
                    hurt communities when they collapse. I also learned that I have a habit of spending a pointless amount of time on things that arent actually specifically 
                    part of the assignment and it would have been a lot easier to just do research and write a paper or something then this. I also started it late I should have 
                    worked on it durring winter break. I'm sorry for it being late but I hope you enjoyed it.
